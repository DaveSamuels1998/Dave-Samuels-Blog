### Deployment Configuration

<br>
<br>

1. Click on "Promote this server to a domain controller"
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

2. Toggle "Add a new forest" because this a new environment setup so that means we don't have any existing domains or forest.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

3. Fill in the "Root domain name" text field. Since I will be hosting my domain on a static IP I can call it whatever I want. If you have your domain on the internet then you might have to change your domain name depending if it is already taken by someone else.

<br>
<br>
9. We will get a bunch of error messages but we are setting up a basic DNS server environment on a static IP address so we don't have to worry about those messages. Just click "Next".
<br>

<br>
<br>
10. Your PC will restart on it's own and starting applying computer settings. This process will take a while.
<br>
<br>
11. After your computer has finishing restarting, go to "Other User" and check to see if  "Sign in to: (Your Domain Name)" is present. If it is that means your domain is up and running. Also it means that the user that you will create will be apart of your domain.

With Server manager we can containerizes and maintain users computers and OUs with active directory users and computers. I will be exploring more of the features within active directory in this post.

### How to find a user in an active directory?

 Answer: In the manager server you click on "active directory users and computers" and then you right click on the computers directory and click on "find". Then you click on the directory navigation and click on "entire directory". You do this because the user may not be in the computer directory or within a certain OU so searching from entire directory will search everything. You should see the user show up after this step.

You can click on "view" in the navigation bar within active directory users and computers and click on advanced features. This will give addition information about users whenever you search for them. If I repeat the steps in order to find a users within the active directory, I can see which directory they are in. 

## Enable Recycle Bin

Enabling recycle bin is useful because if you delete something by accident you can retrieve.

#### Steps to enable recycle bin

1. Go to the Windows Start button and search for "windows administrative tools"

2. Look for "Active Directory Administrative Center"

3. Click on your local domain name

4. Enable Recycle bin (located to the right sidebar).




## Account Creation
It is best practice to have a user with roles that you can copy from instead of creating a user and manually assigning them roles and permissions.

#### Steps to create a user account from an existing user
1. Click on an established user and copy it
2. Then fill out the required text fields such as name and password
3. The permissions and the active directory they are already set to the user that you copied from.

## CMD Commands

1. `` ipconfig`` 
``ipconfig`` command gives you the ip address of the computer you are using
2. ``ipconfig/all``
 `` ipconfig/all`` command gives you all the ip addresses in the network.
 If you see `` DCHP Enabled. . .  Yes``  that means computer is grabbing an ip address from Dynamic Configuration Host Protocol. 
 If you see `` DCHP Enabled. . .  No`` then your computer is using a static ip address.

What are some real world use cases for static ips?

Answer: So real world use cases for static ips would be assigning a printer a static ip in a work place. Since the ip address might change in a work place it is good to have a static ip on a printer. If the ip address on a printer changes you cannot print to that printer anymore so it is good practice give the printer a static ip address so you can print to it indefinitely.

3. ``net use`` 
This command will tell you the shared drives that a person is connected too.
4. `` net user (user domain name) /domain``
Example: `` net user helpdesk1 /domain``
This shows you information about the user domain that you enter. For example what time their password expires, what group they are apart of etc.

#### Sidenote

When putting in commands in a terminal the ``?`` mark is there to help you. If you don't know the properties/extension of a command put a ``?`` on it.
## Enable Administrator account

In file explorer right click on "This PC" and click on "Manage".
Go to the "local users and groups" folder and navigate to the "users" folder
Then double click "administrator" or right click and click on "properties".
Uncheck "Account is disabled".

### Enabling Administrator account across multiple PCs

It is good practice to just have one administrator account for one PC and have that account span on multiple PCs. Whenever you set up a new PC/VM make sure to enable administrator account.
