### Client/Server Model

A client/server model uses a dedicated server to host and provide the network resources(files, scanners, printers, etc.) This is the leading model in business networks.

<br>
<br>

### Pros

* Administration and backup are easier
  		  - Reason being that all the resources are sitting on one central machine(the server). 
  		 When you back up the server you backup all the files.
* Better scalability 
  		    If you want to expand you can do so with cloud architecture or additional servers.
* Easier management

### Cons

* Expensive
  			Requires dedicated hardware and operating systems.
* Requires highly specialized skillset to use

### Peer-to-Peer Mode

Where machines (laptops, desktop) share resources together directly.

### Pros

* Cheap
* Easy to setup

### Cons

* Administration and backups are very difficult
  		  This is because all the files are located in different places
* Poor scalability 
* Complex when you have multiple systems/devices
