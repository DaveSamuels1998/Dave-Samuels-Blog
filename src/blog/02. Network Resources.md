### Client/Server Model
A client/server model uses a dedicated server to host and provide the network resources(files, scanners, printers, etc.) This is the leading model in business networks.
### Pros
- Administration and backup are easier
	  - Reason being that all the resources are sitting on one central machine(the server). 
	 When you back up the server you backup all the files.

- Better scalability 
	    If you want to expand you can do so with cloud architecture or additional servers.
- Easier management
### Cons
- Expensive
		Requires dedicated hardware and operating systems.
- Requires highly specialized skillset to use
  
### Peer-to-Peer Mode
Where machines (laptops, desktop) share resources together directly.

### Pros
- Cheap
- Easy to setup
  

  
### Cons
- Administration and backups are very difficult
	  This is because all the files are located in different places
- Poor scalability 
- Complex when you have multiple systems/devices
