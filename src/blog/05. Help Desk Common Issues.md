## Introduction

<br>
<br>
In this blog I want to explore more on why we made the two accounts, the Helpdesk account and the user account. With both of these accounts I will be going over how to unlock an account, how to change your password, how to reset an account, what it means when a computer falls of the domain etc. 

<br>
<br>

### CMD Commands for working with a user

<br>
<br>
1. First you should see if you can ping anything. I pinged my server with the domain name (davesworld.com) with the IP address of 10.1.10.2 using the ``ping`` command. It is important to know the IP address of whatever you want to ping. Multiple companies can have the same domain name but not the same IP address.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

2. If you want a continuous ping the use the command ``ping -t`` . For example ``ping 10.1.10.2 -t`` . The continuous ping is useful whenever you are working with a PC and you have to restart the computer. You will get a continuous ping when the PC is on and when it is restarted, the command prompt will say timeout on it, then start the continuous ping when the PC is back up and running. Control^ C stops the continuous ping.

2. Navigate to "Computer" OU then look for the PC account that is disabled. If you see an arrow pointing down, that means that the account is disabled. In my cause Desktop2 is the computer that is disabled.

<br>
<br>

You have to rejoin the PC back into the domain.

## Summary

<br>
<br>
In this lab, I discussed common Help Desk issues, such as account lockouts, disabled accounts, and PCs falling off the domain. I demonstrated how these issues appear from the user's perspective and provided solutions for each problem. Additionally, I showcased useful CMD commands for working with user accounts, including the `ping` command to check if requests can successfully reach their PC.
